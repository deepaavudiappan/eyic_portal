					<p>We are in the process of conducting the 2-day workshop for teacher teams in various regions of the country in 
					February and March 2015. We will be launching the e-Yantra Robotics Teacher Competition (eYRTC) by early 
					April -- Teacher teams implement a project using the robotiic kit (given to them at the end of the workshop) 
					over a period of 3 months to complete their training in a Project Based Learning(PBL) mode.
					</p>

					<p>Colleges can initiate their Purchase Process at this time. All colleges MUST procure the equipment and set up the lab 
						such that labs are formally inaugurated during the Finals of eYRTC, four months from now. Note that colleges may establish 
						the lab and start using it even before the formal lab inaugurations.
					</p>	
					
					<p>You can choose any vendor who can supply robots of specifications provided in the list of equipment, 
						by following due purchase process as required by your college. e-Yantra team does not recommend any specific vendor 
						for your purchase.
